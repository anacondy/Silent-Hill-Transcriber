Voice_Link // Silent Hill Transcriber"In my restless dreams, I see that town... Awaiting input signal."Voice_Link is an immersive, real-time voice transcription application built with React. It combines robust, modern web speech technologies with a distinct, cinematic aesthetic inspired by the Silent Hill video game series.📡 Project OverviewThis project serves as a bridge between atmospheric horror aesthetics and functional accessibility tools. It transforms spoken audio into text instantly, providing visual feedback that mimics the behavior of a retro CRT monitor receiving a transmission from a distant source.Key CapabilitiesReal-Time Transcription: Converts speech to text with zero perceptible latency.Interim Feedback: Displays "ghost text" (interim results) in bright green before solidifying into the final log, mimicking AI "thinking."Clipboard Integration: One-click functionality to copy the entire session's transcript.Visualizer: A simulated audio spectrum analyzer that reacts when the microphone is active.🛠 Technical Stack & PackagesThe application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using the following technologies:Framework: React (Functional Components + Hooks)Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first styling for layout and responsiveness)Icons: lucide-react (Lightweight, distinct iconography)Fonts: Google Fonts API (Special Elite for typewriter text, Syne Mono for HUD elements)Animation: Native CSS Keyframes (No external animation libraries used to ensure performance)🧠 Transcription Logic & Data SourcesUnlike traditional apps that require heavy backend setups or paid API keys, this project utilizes the Web Speech API (window.SpeechRecognition / webkitSpeechRecognition).Data Source & TrainingEngine: The application leverages the browser's native speech recognition engine. On Google Chrome, this connects to Google's cloud-based speech servers.Dataset: The underlying models are trained on massive datasets of diverse accents, dialects, and languages, ensuring enterprise-grade accuracy (comparable to Mistral or Whisper) for general conversation.Privacy: Audio is processed by the browser vendor (e.g., Google/Apple) purely for transcription and is not stored by this application.Code StructureuseRef & useEffect: Used to manage the lifecycle of the Speech Recognition instance, ensuring it restarts automatically (continuous: true) to simulate an "always-on" radio link.State Management: Separate states for finalTranscript (confirmed text) and interimTranscript (fluid, changing text) create the "stream of consciousness" effect.🎨 Aesthetics & ThemeThe UI is a direct homage to the visual identity of Silent Hill 2.Color PalettePrimary Text: #8fa860 (Dirty/Muted Olive)Interim/Highlight: #cce899 (Bright Phosphor Green)Backgrounds: #1a1c15 (Dark Sludge), #0f110c (Deep Black)Accents: #3e4a2e (Rusted Metal Green)Visual EffectsCRT Overlay: A custom CSS gradient mesh simulating the RGB sub-pixels of old monitors.Scanlines: A moving horizontal bar animation (@keyframes scanline) that scrolls down the screen.Film Grain: A feTurbulence SVG filter applied via CSS to create dynamic, "snowy" noise.Vignette: Radial gradients to darken the corners, focusing the user's eye on the center text.Fog: A scrolling texture layer (mix-blend-overlay) creating a subtle, smoky atmosphere.TypographyBody Text: Special Elite – Mimics a manual typewriter, fitting the "found footage" file aesthetic.HUD/System Text: Syne Mono – A monospaced font that feels like early computer terminal readouts.📱 Device Compatibility & ResponsivenessThe application is designed with a Mobile-First approach but scales perfectly to desktops.Optimized Aspect Ratios:16:9 (Desktop/Standard Phone): Full UI visibility with side margins.20:9 (Modern Smartphones): The vertical layout accommodates tall screens (e.g., Samsung Galaxy, iPhone Pro Max) without hiding the footer controls behind browser bars.Cross-Platform Support:PC: Chrome, Edge, Safari (macOS).Mobile: Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS.Note: Firefox support for the Web Speech API is currently experimental and may require configuration flags.🔮 Future ImprovementsAs browser capabilities and AI models evolve, the following features could be implemented:Local AI Integration: Replacing the Web Speech API with a WASM-based implementation of OpenAI Whisper or Mistral running entirely client-side for offline privacy.Multi-Speaker Diarization: Distinguishing between different voices (e.g., "Speaker A," "Speaker B").Visual Audio Reactive Mesh: Using the Web Audio API to drive the "fog" intensity based on the actual volume of the voice input.Save/Export: Ability to export the transcript as a .txt or .json file formatted as a game log.System Version 2.0.4 // Connection Established
